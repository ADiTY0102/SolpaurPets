we need a card formated profiles for aur dog /pet adoption website
where we need functionality of filter and search at navbar. 

we also need that when pet profile is created and the profile 
with #dog should be automatically shown in the cards form on the dogPet.html 

we need cards in the form of an image of pet which will come from his profile and below that pets name will be shown 
when we hover on image it should be showing info of pet
            1)name pet
            2)Age pet
            3)Vaccinated(y/n)
            4)Contact No of owner
            5)Address of owner

here im explaining flow ====
very first assume that user profile is created 
user is trying to adopt pet so he will move to filters which ever breed he wants
you should show like wise 

after in second seanerio user is trying to donate a pet
at that time he will provide all the details in the form on user dashboard ( i'll create that manualyy you dont need to do that)
after successfully filling form all the details will be shown on the dogPet.html in the form of card as i told earlier
